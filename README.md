# PyTgCalls [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/py-tgcalls.svg?logo=python&logoColor=%23959DA5&label=pypi&labelColor=%23282f37)](https://pypi.org/project/py-tgcalls/) [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pepy/dt/py-tgcalls?logoColor=%23959DA5&labelColor=%23282f37&color=%2328A745)](https://pepy.tech/project/py-tgcalls)
This project allows making Telegram call using MtProto and WebRTC, this is possible thanks to the power of [NTgCalls] library and [@evgeny-nadymov]

#### Example Usage
```python
from pytgcalls import PyTgCalls
from pytgcalls import idle
...
chat_id = -1001185324811
app = PyTgCalls(client)
app.start()
app.play(
    chat_id,
    'http://docs.evostream.com/sample_content/assets/sintel1m720p.mp4',
)
idle()
```

## Features
- Prebuilt wheels for macOS, Linux and Windows.
- Supporting all type of MTProto libraries: Pyrogram, Telethon and Hydrogram.
- Work with voice chats in channels and chats.
- Join as channels or chats.
- Mute/unmute, pause/resume, stop/play, volume control and more...
- **ðŸ†• Advanced Memory Management**: Automatic memory leak prevention and monitoring
- **ðŸ†• Cache Optimization**: Intelligent cache cleanup and management
- **ðŸ†• Resource Cleanup**: Proper shutdown and resource management

## Memory Management Features

PyTgCalls now includes advanced memory management to prevent memory leaks:

```python
# Initialize with memory management
call_py = PyTgCalls(
    app,
    enable_memory_manager=True,  # Enable automatic memory management
    memory_cleanup_interval=300,  # Cleanup every 5 minutes
    cache_duration=3600,  # Cache duration 1 hour
)

# Monitor memory usage
stats = call_py.get_memory_stats()
print(f"Memory Usage: {stats['usage']['rss_mb']:.1f} MB")

# Force cleanup
await call_py.force_cleanup()

# Proper shutdown
await call_py.shutdown()
```

For detailed memory management documentation, see [MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md](MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md).

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher.
- An MTProto Client
- A [Telegram API key](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/setup#api-keys).
- **Optional**: `psutil` for memory monitoring features
